2. Check the **bottom-right corner**
3. You should see: **"CleverKeys#4018"** in jewel purple on silver
4. ✅ If you see the branding = CleverKeys is active!
5. ❌ If NO branding = Wrong keyboard (switch to CleverKeys)

### Step 4: Quick Function Test (30 seconds)
**Test**: Do you see the keyboard keys when you activate CleverKeys?

✅ **Expected**: Keys display normally
❌ **If keys don't appear**: Report immediately (regression)

### Step 4: Quick Feature Test (2 minutes)
Try these 6 quick tests:

| Test | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|----------------|
| **Display** ⭐ | Activate keyboard | **Keys visible** (crash fixed) |
| **Type** | Tap keys: "hello world" | Characters appear |
| **Predict** | Type "th" | See "the", "that", "this" |
| **Swipe** | Swipe h→e→l→l→o | "hello" appears |
| **Correct** | Type "teh " (with space) | Autocorrects to "the" |
