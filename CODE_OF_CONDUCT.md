## Specific Scenarios

### Technical Disagreements

**Healthy Debate:**
```

```

❌ "Anyone who uses X framework doesn't know what they're doing."
❌ "This is obviously wrong." (without explanation)
```

### Feature Requests

**Constructive:**
```
✅ "I'd like to suggest [feature] because it would help with [use case]."

```

**Unconstructive:**
```
