## 📱 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### 1. Check Your Device Screen
Look at your Android device - you should see either:
- Dictionary Manager (title: "Custom Dictionary")
- OR CleverKeys Settings

### 2. Open Testing Guide
I've already opened: **LIVE_TESTING_SESSION.md**

### 3. Follow Testing Steps (30-45 min)
- Test dictionary validation
- Test word list and deletion
- **CRITICAL**: Test prediction integration (add "CleverKeys", verify it appears in suggestions)
- Test clipboard search and filtering

### 4. Report Results
Say: "all tests passed" or describe which test failed

## 🔴 MOST CRITICAL TEST

**Add custom word "CleverKeys" → Type "Clev" → Verify it appears in predictions**

If this works, the dictionary is truly functional!
