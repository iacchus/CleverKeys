# 🔀 REDIRECT: This file has moved!

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: This file has been replaced with a better entry point.

## 👉 Please read this file instead:

# **[`00_START_HERE_FIRST.md`](00_START_HERE_FIRST.md)**

The new file starts with "00_" so it **sorts to the top** of file listings, making it easier to find.

---

## Why the change?

In Part 6.2 (Nov 14, 2025), we created `00_START_HERE_FIRST.md` to solve a discoverability problem:
- **Problem**: With 40+ markdown files in root, `START_HERE.md` was buried in the middle
- **Solution**: Use "00_" prefix so it sorts first in alphabetical listings
- **Result**: New users see the entry point immediately

---

## What's in the new file?

Everything from this file, plus:
- Updated helper scripts (5 scripts with --help)
- Complete scripts reference (SCRIPTS_REFERENCE.md)
- Updated documentation organization
- Clearer navigation

## Quick Links (if you're in a hurry)
