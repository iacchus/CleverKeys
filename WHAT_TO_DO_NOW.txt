The keyboard app is INSTALLED on your device. You just need to ENABLE it.

STEP 1: Open Android Settings App
   - Tap the Settings icon on your home screen or app drawer
   
STEP 2: Navigate to Keyboard Settings
   Path: Settings → System → Languages & input → On-screen keyboard
   Alternative: Settings → Languages & input → Virtual keyboard
   
STEP 3: Tap "Manage keyboards"
   
STEP 4: Find "CleverKeys (Debug)" in the list
   
STEP 5: Toggle the switch to ON
   - Accept any permission dialogs that appear
   
STEP 6: Open ANY text app
   - Messages, Notes, Chrome, Email, anything with a text field
   
STEP 7: Tap a text field to open the keyboard
   
STEP 8: Look for the keyboard switcher icon (⌨️)
   - Usually at bottom-right of screen
   - Or in the navigation bar
   - Or long-press the space bar
   
STEP 9: Select "CleverKeys (Debug)" from the list

STEP 10: TEST IT!
   - Type "hello world" (tap keys)
   - Type "th" (see predictions: "the", "that", "this")
   - Swipe h→e→l→l→o (see "hello" appear)
   - Type "teh " with space (autocorrects to "the")

IF ALL 5 WORK → SUCCESS! You've validated the entire project! 🎉
