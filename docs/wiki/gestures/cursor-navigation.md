# Cursor Navigation

Move the text cursor precisely using the spacebar slider or TrackPoint mode without lifting your fingers from the keyboard.

## Quick Summary

| What | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Purpose** | Position cursor in text without tapping screen |
| **Methods** | Spacebar swipe, TrackPoint mode |
| **Precision** | Proportional to swipe speed/distance |

## Method 1: Spacebar Swipe

The most intuitive way to move the cursor:

### How to Use

1. **Touch the spacebar** and swipe left or right
2. Cursor moves proportionally to swipe distance
3. **Release** when positioned

### Features

- **Proportional speed**: Faster/longer swipe = cursor moves further
- **Visual feedback**: Trail shows movement direction
- **Immediate**: Cursor moves as you swipe

> [!TIP]

For continuous joystick-style control:

### How to Use

1. **Long-press the nav key** (between spacebar and enter)
2. Feel haptic activation (if enabled)
3. **Move finger** in any direction like a joystick
4. Cursor moves continuously in that direction
5. **Release** to stop

A: Use [Selection Delete](selection-delete.md) mode by short-swiping on the backspace key and holding.

### Q: Can I move cursor vertically?

A: Use TrackPoint mode for vertical cursor movement by long-pressing the nav key.
