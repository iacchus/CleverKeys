# Basic Typing

CleverKeys supports two main input methods: tap typing and swipe typing. This guide covers the fundamentals.

## Tap Typing

Tap typing works like any standard keyboard:

- Tap each key to type the corresponding letter
- Tap **Shift** to capitalize the next letter
- Double-tap **Shift** for CAPS LOCK
- Tap **Backspace** to delete the last character

## Swipe Typing

Swipe typing lets you type words by drawing a path through the letters:

1. Place your finger on the first letter
2. Without lifting, drag through each letter of the word
3. Lift your finger when done
4. CleverKeys predicts your word using neural AI

### Example: Typing "hello"

1. Start on **H**
2. Slide to **E**
3. Slide to **L** (stay there briefly for double L)
4. Slide to **O**
5. Lift your finger

The neural prediction engine analyzes your path and suggests "hello".

## Predictions Bar

The prediction bar appears above the keyboard showing word suggestions:

- **Tap** a suggestion to insert it
- The **center** suggestion is usually the best match
- **Long-press** a suggestion to see alternatives

## Auto-Corrections

CleverKeys automatically corrects common typos:

- Mistyped letters are fixed
- Capitalization is corrected (sentence start)
- Double-space inserts a period

## Special Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Shift** | Capitalize next letter |
| **Backspace** | Delete last character |
| **Space** | Insert space, slide for cursor |
| **Enter** | New line or submit |
| **?123** | Switch to numbers/symbols |

## Gestures on Keys

Each key supports directional swipes:

- **Swipe up** on a letter: often types the uppercase version
- **Swipe in any direction**: customizable actions

See [Short Swipes](../gestures/short-swipes.md) for gesture details.

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with tap typing** to learn the layout
2. **Try swipe typing** for common words first
3. **Trust the predictions** - lift your finger and see the suggestions
4. **Use the prediction bar** to save keystrokes
