# First-Time Setup

After enabling CleverKeys, take a few minutes to configure it for your preferences.

## Initial Configuration

When you first use CleverKeys, we recommend:

1. **Test the keyboard** by typing in any app
2. **Adjust the height** if keys feel too small/large
3. **Choose your theme** (CleverKeys Dark, CleverKeys Light, or Monet for Material You)
4. **Select your language** for swipe predictions

## Accessing Settings

Open CleverKeys settings:

1. Find **CleverKeys** in your app drawer and tap it
2. Or long-press the **gear icon** on the keyboard (if visible)
3. Or go to **Android Settings > System > Languages & input > On-screen keyboard > CleverKeys**

## Recommended First Settings

### Keyboard Height

- **Location**: Scroll to **Appearance** section in Settings
- **Setting**: Keyboard Height slider
- **Default**: 100%
- **Tip**: Try 85-95% for most phones. 100% may be too large.

### Theme

- **Location**: Tap **Theme Manager** in the Activities section
- **Options**: CleverKeys Dark (default), CleverKeys Light, Black, White, Monet (Material You on Android 12+)
- **Tip**: Black theme saves battery on OLED screens

### Haptic Feedback

- **Location**: Scroll to **Haptics** section in Settings
- **Settings**:
  - Haptic Feedback: On/Off toggle
  - Haptic Feedback Duration: Adjust vibration strength
- **Tip**: Start with default duration, adjust if too weak or strong

### Primary Language

- **Location**: Scroll to **Multi-Language** section in Settings
- **Setting**: Tap to configure languages
- **Note**: English is included by default. Add more via Language Packs.

## Optional Customizations

### Extra Keys Row

Add a row of function keys above the keyboard:

- **Location**: Tap **Extra Keys** in the Activities section
- **Popular additions**: Tab, Ctrl, Arrow keys, Clipboard
- **Tip**: Drag keys to reorder them

### Swipe Sensitivity

Adjust how sensitive swipe detection is:

- **Location**: Scroll to **Gesture Tuning** section in Settings
- **Settings**: Short Swipe Threshold, Swipe Velocity Threshold
- **Lower threshold**: More sensitive (easier to trigger)
- **Higher threshold**: Less sensitive (requires more deliberate swipes)

### Prediction Bar

Configure word suggestions:

- **Location**: Scroll to **Neural Prediction** section in Settings
- **Settings**:
  - Show Suggestions: On/Off
  - Beam Width: Higher = more candidates (default: 6)

## Quick Test

Try these to verify your setup:

1. **Tap test**: Type "hello" by tapping each letter
2. **Swipe test**: Swipe "keyboard" without lifting
3. **Gesture test**: Swipe up on any letter to see the subkey
4. **Backspace test**: Long-press backspace to delete continuously

> [!TIP]
> Use the built-in test keyboard field at the top of the Settings screen to test without leaving the app.

## Troubleshooting

### Keyboard is too small/large

Adjust **Keyboard Height** in the Appearance section of Settings.

### Predictions are inaccurate

- Set correct primary language in Multi-Language section
- Type more words to train the neural model
- Increase **Beam Width** in Neural Prediction section (default: 6, max: 10)

### Haptics don't work

- Check that **Haptic Feedback** is enabled in Haptics section
- Verify device vibration is not disabled in Android system settings
- Some devices have separate "Touch vibration" system settings
