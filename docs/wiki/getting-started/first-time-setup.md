# First-Time Setup

After enabling CleverKeys, take a few minutes to configure it for your preferences.

## Initial Configuration

When you first use CleverKeys, we recommend:

1. **Test the keyboard** by typing in any app
2. **Adjust the height** if keys feel too small/large
3. **Choose your theme** (light, dark, or system)
4. **Select your language** for swipe predictions

## Accessing Settings

Open CleverKeys settings:

1. Find **CleverKeys** in your app drawer
2. Or go to **Android Settings → System → CleverKeys**
3. Or long-press the **gear icon** on the keyboard

## Recommended First Settings

### Keyboard Height

- Path: Settings → Appearance → Keyboard Height
- Default: 100%
- Tip: Try 90-110% based on your hand size

### Theme

- Path: Settings → Appearance → Theme
- Options: Light, Dark, Auto (follows system)
- Tip: Dark theme works best for OLED screens

### Haptic Feedback

- Path: Settings → Haptics
- Enable vibration for tactile key response
- Adjust vibration strength (light to strong)

### Primary Language

- Path: Settings → Languages → Primary Language
- Select your main typing language
- This affects swipe predictions and autocorrect

## Optional Customizations

### Extra Keys Row

Add a row of function keys above the keyboard:

- Path: Settings → Layout → Extra Keys
- Popular additions: Tab, Ctrl, Arrow keys

### Swipe Sensitivity

Adjust how sensitive swipe detection is:

- Path: Settings → Swipe Typing → Swipe Sensitivity
- Lower: More precise but slower
- Higher: Faster but may misread

### Prediction Bar

Configure word suggestions:

- Path: Settings → Input → Predictions
- Enable/disable prediction bar
- Adjust number of suggestions

## Quick Test

Try these to verify your setup:

1. **Tap test**: Type "hello" by tapping each letter
2. **Swipe test**: Swipe "keyboard" without lifting
3. **Gesture test**: Swipe up on any letter
4. **Backspace test**: Long-press backspace to delete multiple characters

## Troubleshooting

### Keyboard is too small/large

Adjust keyboard height in Settings → Appearance

### Predictions are inaccurate

- Set correct primary language
- Type more words to train the neural model
- Increase beam width in Neural Settings

### Haptics don't work

- Check that vibration is enabled
- Grant vibration permission if prompted
- Verify device vibration is not disabled system-wide
