## Using the Tile

**Tap the CleverKeys tile** to open the system keyboard picker. From there, select any installed keyboard.

### Tile States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Highlighted/colored** | CleverKeys is your current keyboard |
| **Dimmed/gray** | Another keyboard is currently active |

## Requirements

- Android 7.0 (Nougat) or higher

## Why Use This?

- **Fast switching** - No need to open Settings app
- **One-handed access** - Swipe down and tap

## Troubleshooting

### Tile not appearing in available tiles?
- Ensure CleverKeys is installed
- Ensure CleverKeys is enabled in **Settings > System > Languages & Input > On-screen keyboard**

### Tile does nothing when tapped?
- The system keyboard picker should appear
- If it doesn't, the tile will open keyboard settings as a fallback

### Tile always shows inactive?
- This means another keyboard is currently set as default
- Tap the tile to switch to CleverKeys
