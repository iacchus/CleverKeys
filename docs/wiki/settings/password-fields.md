# Password Field Mode

CleverKeys automatically provides enhanced security when you're typing in password or PIN fields.

## How It Works

When you tap on a password field, CleverKeys automatically:

- **Disables predictions** - No word suggestions appear to protect your password
- **Disables autocorrect** - Your password won't be "corrected" accidentally
- **Disables swipe typing** - Tap-only input for security
- **Shows the password bar** - Special interface replaces the suggestion bar

## Password Visibility Toggle

A special password bar appears with an eye icon on the right side:

| Icon | State | Display |
|------|-------|---------|
| Eye with slash | Hidden (default) | Bullet dots: `••••••••` |
| Open eye | Visible | Actual password text |

**Tap the eye icon** to toggle between hidden and visible states.

## Scrolling Long Passwords

If your password is longer than the visible area:
- **Swipe left/right** on the password text to scroll
- The eye icon stays fixed on the right side

## Supported Field Types

Password mode activates automatically for:

- Text password fields
- Web password fields (browser forms)
- Visible password fields
- PIN/numeric password fields

## Privacy & Security

- Password text is **only stored in memory** (never saved to disk)
- Text is **cleared immediately** when you switch fields or close the keyboard
- The keyboard only **reads** the password field - it never modifies content
- Password is **hidden by default** - you must tap to reveal

## Tips

1. **Check for the eye icon** - If you see it, password mode is active
2. **Tap to toggle visibility** - Useful to verify complex passwords
3. **Scroll for long passwords** - Drag left/right on the dots to see more
4. **Predictions are intentionally disabled** - This is a security feature

## Related Settings

Password mode is automatic and cannot be disabled. This ensures your passwords are always protected when using CleverKeys.
