v1.1.81 - Long Word Prediction & Neural Tuning

Major improvements:
- Fixed long word prediction (e.g. "dangerously" now works!)
- Length-normalized beam search scoring for fair word comparison
- Neural presets: Speed, Balanced, Accuracy modes
- Temperature and frequency weight controls in Neural Settings
- Swipe Debug tool redesigned with copy/save actions
- On-device learning: manage your local training samples

Technical:
- Beam search deduplication and early termination tuning
- Touch smoothing control for swipe trajectories
- Optimized feature extraction pipeline
