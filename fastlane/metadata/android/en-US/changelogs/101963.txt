Bug fixes for multilanguage support:

- Fix crash when importing large language packs (Spanish 236k words caused OOM)
- Limited secondary dictionary trie insertions to top 30k most frequent words
- Fix frequency display in Dictionary Manager (was showing 100 for all)
- Now properly reads and displays frequency ranks from V2 binary format
