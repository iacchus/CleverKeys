v1.1.99 - Text Assist & Replace Text Fix

FIXED: textAssist and replaceText actions now work
- Uses ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT intent instead of unsupported context menu
- Shows app chooser (Google Assistant, translators, etc.)
- Works when text is selected in any app
- Falls back gracefully if no text selected
