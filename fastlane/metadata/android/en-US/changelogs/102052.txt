v1.2.5 - Language Pack Autocorrect Fix

LAYOUT NOTE: The default US QWERTY layout has repositioned some subkeys to the keyboard perimeter. This reduces conflicts between short swipe gestures and word swipes (e.g., east subkey on 'W' vs swiping 'we'). To restore the classic layout, go to Settings > Layout Manager and select "QWERTY Latin US (Julow)".

NEW FEATURES (since v1.2.2):

• TrackPoint Mode - Hold nav key to enter joystick cursor control
  - Move finger in any direction, cursor follows proportionally
  - Diagonal movement support (NE moves up+right)
  - Speed scales with distance from center

• Selection-Delete Mode - Short swipe + hold backspace
  - Swipe left/right/up/down to select text
  - Release to delete selection
  - Configurable vertical threshold and speed

• Settings Search - Find any setting instantly
  - Real-time filtering with keyword synonyms
  - Scrolls to setting with pulse highlight

• Granular Haptic Feedback - Per-event controls
  - Toggle haptics for: key press, predictions, TrackPoint, etc.

• Short Swipe Calibration - Practice and tune gestures

FIXES:
• Auto-capitalization now works after periods
• Double-space-to-period toggle added
• Updated US QWERTY layout subkeys
• Fixed suggestion selection returning wrong word (issue #63)
• Fixed WordPredictor not loading language pack dictionaries
