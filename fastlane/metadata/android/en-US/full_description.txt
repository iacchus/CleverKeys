CleverKeys is an open-source gesture keyboard featuring a custom neural network engine, unlimited clipboard history, and extensive customization. Unlike other open-source keyboards, gesture typing works reliably everywhere — including Termux and terminal emulators.

<b>RELIABLE GESTURE TYPING IN TERMUX</b>
CleverKeys is the only open-source keyboard with stable, production-ready gesture typing that works in Termux. Other keyboards either disable gestures in terminals, produce corrupted output, or remain in alpha/experimental state. CleverKeys works everywhere — terminal emulators, SSH sessions, and developer tools.

<b>NEURAL NETWORK SWIPE ENGINE</b>
• Custom transformer neural network trained for gesture recognition
• Sub-100ms predictions with XNNPACK hardware acceleration
• 100% local processing — works offline, no cloud dependency
• Tunable beam search (width, length normalization, pruning, early stopping)
• Open training code and datasets at github.com/tribixbite/CleverKeys-ML

<b>208 CUSTOMIZABLE SHORT-SWIPE GESTURES</b>
• 8 directions × 26 letter keys = 208 one-touch gestures
• Per-key customization — assign any action to any direction on any key
• Navigation: arrow keys, home/end, page up/down
• Editing: select all, undo/redo, cut/copy/paste
• Function keys: F1-F12, Escape, Insert, Delete
• No long-press menus needed

<b>UNLIMITED CLIPBOARD HISTORY</b>
As an Input Method Editor, CleverKeys has legitimate clipboard access that other apps lack:
• Truly unlimited history (configurable by count or storage size)
• Pin important items for quick access
• Full-text search through history
• Persistent across reboots
• Export/Import for backup

<b>PRIVACY FIRST</b>
• Zero network permissions — literally cannot phone home
• No analytics, telemetry, or tracking
• No cloud sync or data collection
• All processing on-device
• Open source = fully auditable

<b>EXTENSIVE THEME ENGINE</b>
• 18+ built-in themes including Material You (Monet)
• DIY theme creator with full control over colors
• Key colors, label colors, border colors, swipe trail effects
• ePaper, Neon, Everforest, and more styles

<b>100+ KEYBOARD LAYOUTS</b>
• QWERTY, AZERTY, QWERTZ, Dvorak, Colemak
• Programming layouts with special characters
• International layouts for 30+ languages
• Customizable bottom row and modifiers

<b>POWER USER FEATURES</b>
• Terminal mode with Ctrl/Meta/Fn keys
• Backup & Restore all settings and custom data
• Layout profile import/export with gestures included

CleverKeys is a complete Kotlin rewrite of Unexpected Keyboard with neural network gesture typing, clipboard history, and per-key gesture customization added. The ML model architecture, training code, and datasets are all publicly available.
