**Current Version**: 1.0.6 (versionCode 100063 for x86_64)
**GitHub Release**: https://github.com/tribixbite/CleverKeys/releases/tag/v1.0.6
**F-Droid MR**: https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/merge_requests/30449

### Versioning Workflow
1. Development: `dev-{sha}` with versionCode 1
2. Release: Tag with `vX.Y.Z` and push
3. GitHub Actions automatically creates release with APKs
4. F-Droid automatically detects new tags and builds
